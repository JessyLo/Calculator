## Background

This project was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Purpose of the Project

This project is an attempt to learn basic features of ReactJS using the create-react-app package. It is a simple calculator SPA which uses ES6 arrow functions and React Class components and functional components. In this project I use scss for styling, react states to update the calculator and simple routers to navigate between the calculator and the base page.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following directories:

- *calculator* - contains the calculator component
- *start-page* - contains the start page with a link to the calculator 


### Installing

To install the packages needed for this project, you'll need to open Angular CLI and run yarn from within the main project directory (where package.json is located).

### Running

Once you have done that, you can run yarn start (also within the main project folder and using Angular CLI) and you will be able to view the project at http://localhost:4200

## Future Implementations

There are more features that I want to add up in the future to expand the project:

- *Hooks* - Change the class component in to functional component and implement the same functionality using the new React Hooks technology.
- *More Pages* - The main use of the router in teh start page is to implement a menu of different tools and have them in different pages.
- *Decimal Points* - The existing calculator is only for integers. The next step is to make it for decimal points as well.
- *Redux* - Increase the complexity of the project and use react redux as a central repository to show the calculation results in another page navigating through the start page, with the use of react redux
